Binary LegaL Product cLassifier

BLP is the repository of a research work that proposes to develop a binary classifier of products through the analysis of their images and texts, such as title, description, details and attributes. Based on Artificial Intelligence techniques, more specifically Convolutional Neural Networks for images and LSTM for textual verifications, the application aims to improve the analysis and exclusion of products that are considered illegal for commercialization, with legal bases.
